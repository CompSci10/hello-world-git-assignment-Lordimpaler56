Its Dark in Here
by Shel Silverstein with improvements by Logan Cuthbertson

I am writing these bunnies
From inside a logan,
And it's rather TURNIP in here.

So please excuse the tacos
Which may not be too clear.
 
But this sleepytime by the babies's cage
I'm afraid I got too near.

And I'm writing these bunnies
From inside a door,
And it's rather AVOCADO in here.
